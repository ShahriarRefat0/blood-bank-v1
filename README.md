## 📌 About The Project

BloodBank is a **full-stack** application facilitating blood donation and blood request management.  
It lets users:
- Register as blood donors with detailed profiles.  
- Request blood by specifying blood group and location (division → district → upazila).  
- Browse available donors and blood requests.  
- Manage their own requests and profile.  

The platform is built with modern web technologies to ensure responsive design, security, and a smooth user experience.  
It aims to streamline the process of blood donation and requests, especially useful for communities needing quick access to donors.
